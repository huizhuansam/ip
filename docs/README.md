## Usage
Here are some commands to use with AinsleyBot. Be mindful that AinsleyBot can't understand you unless the exact commands and formats are used! The commands are also case-sensitive. Square brackets `[]` denote where users can replace with their own content.

### `add`
Adds a new task in the list.

**General format:** 

`add [type of task] [description] [task-type specific arguments]`

**Example of usage:**

`add todo eat jerk chicken`

Expected outcome:

![Add Example](AddExample.png)

Now you have a `todo` with description of `eat jerk chicken` in the list of tasks!

#### add a todo
**Format:** 

`add todo [description]`

![Add Example](AddExample.png)

**Example:** 

`add todo eat jerk chicken`

**Troubleshoot common errors:**
1. Not adding a description. AinsleyBot does not allow for tasks with empty descriptions (applies for all types of tasks!).

#### add an event
**Format:** 

`add event [description] /at [yyyy-MM-dd] /to [yyyy-MM-dd]`

**Example:** 

`add event give your meat a good ol' rub /at 2021-09-10 /to 2021-09-11`

![Add Event](AddEvent.png)

**Caution:**

AinsleyBot will not check if the event's date happened or ended in the past, or if the last day happens before the first. 

**Troubleshoot common errors:** 
1. Bad date formatting. Please follow the prescribed `yyyy-MM-dd` format exactly.
2. Missing final date. Be sure that the command consists of two dates with the correct delimiters `/at` and `/to`.

#### add a deadline
**Format:** 

`add deadline [description] /by [yyyy-MM-dd]`

**Example:** 

`add deadline create user guide /by 2021-09-10`

![Add Deadline](AddDeadline.png)

**Caution:**

AinsleyBot will not check if the deadline occurred in the past.

**Troubleshoot common errors:**
1. Bad date formatting. Please follow the prescribed `yyyy-MM-dd` format exactly.
2. Missing date. Be sure that the command consists of a date with the correct delimiter `/by`.

### `list`
Shows all your tasks as a list.

**Example:** `list`

**Expected outcome:**

![List Example](List.png)

**Caution:** 

`list` command stands alone! Any additional text after the command will make it invalid. 

### `find`

**Format:** 

`find [keyword]`

**Expected outcome:**

![Find](Find.png)

1. Attempting to mark a task at index more than the current total number of tasks will cause an error.

### `delete`

**Format:** 

`delete [1-based index number]`

**Expected outcome:**

![Delete Example](Delete.png)
